### Oh hello there! :wave:

I'm Ghilain, nice to meet you! Well obviously we cannot talk here (unfortunately?). Let me just summarize who I am.

So, I'm just a young guy, really interested in the programming language theory and everything it comes with (parsers, type systems, etc).
I got into it at around 2018, when I started thinking about creating my own programming language.

I further evolved into making more unfinished programming languages! :tada:

#### Here are some of my projects:

- Back in 2018, I implemented a small assembly language-like programming language running on a Virtual Machine (much like Java).
  It was originally named ‚Äú#\*‚Äù, but was later renamed into ‚ÄúSnow\*‚Äù. The repository is available [here](https://github.com/mesabloo/snowstar_old).
  
  At that time I didn't know C++ really well, but I think I ended up with something not quite bad.
  
- After upgrading the language for about 2 months, I decided to restart the project from scratch, into another direction. That's where the last Snow\* got to life.
  It was still C++, but much less crappy than before. It used [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) for the parsing, and [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) for the code generation and executable creation. The code is available [here](https://github.com/mesabloo/snowstar).
  
- I then stopped Snow\*, especially from lack of motivation...and started a new programming language about 4 months after. It was named ‚ÄúBlob‚Äù, and was meant to guarantee type- and data-safety through the use of complex types (see ‚ÄúQuantitative Type Theory‚Äù on google).
  It was the first time I used Haskell, because something recommended it to me. I ended up enjoying my time with this new programming language I didn't know.
  The language got to a stage where I dropped some features, even before trying to implement them (like the QTT), because of how complicated things would become.
  I later renamed the language ‚ÄúNihil‚Äù, in reference of the fact that's there nothing usable in this programming language.
  
  The repository ([this one](https://github.com/mesabloo/nihil)) is currently the holder of the most :star: on my profile!
  
I also have some other side projects, like my custom [virtual CPU](https://github.com/mesabloo/vcpu) or my [Haskell assembly DSL](https://github.com/mesabloo/hasm).

#### And I do have some other hobbies!

Even though I waste most of my time behing my screen, on my keyboard, I also enjoy eating, tinkering (I like to make rings for no reason), and playing games like BeamNG.Drive or World of Tanks. :video_game:

#### Anything to add?

Yes! There is something I want to add, which I believe is important: you are beautiful the way you are. Don't ever change if you don't want to, and never feel obliged to change for somebody. That's how it gets wrong. :kissing:
